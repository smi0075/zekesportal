            <p style="font-size:20px;font-family:saddle">What is uluru</p>
            <p>uluru is a inselberg meaning island mountain. an inselberg is a isolated, steep-sided hill made out of resistant rock on a plain. uluru is the largest inselberg in the world it is an incredible 863 meters high and is over 530 million years old.</p>
            <p style="font-size:20px;font-family:saddle">how was it formed</p>
            <p>Uluru began to form over 550 million years ago when sand, eroding from the Peterman Ranges, built up into thick deposits. these deposits where then compressed into sandstone by the sea. Which then slowly disapeared leaving only the sandstone. Later geological events caused it to tilt 90 degress creating what we see now.</p>
